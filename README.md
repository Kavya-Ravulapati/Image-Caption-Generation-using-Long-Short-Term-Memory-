# Image-Caption-Generation-using-Long-Short-Term-Memory-

Detecting and recognising objects in an image is one of the most important tasks for a machine learning algorithm. It is even morre challenging for the algorithm to understant what's going on in an image and generate rich captions in English language. This requires a combination of image and natural language processing techniques. 

This project uses LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) to generate rich captions from images.
